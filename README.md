Usage

To run the analysis:

Load the datasets using pandas.

Execute the analysis scripts to generate insights and visualizations.

Review the outputs for decision-making.

Make sure to download and import dataset files in order to run code efficiently 

The datasets for baseline and third follow up required a lot of cleaning and filtering so make sure you follow the code block orders in order to run the summary statistics, ATE treatment and decision tree analysis correctly 

Each code will have a description to ensure the users knows what is happening
